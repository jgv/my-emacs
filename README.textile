h1. ˈiːmæks

p. My Emacs setup. As I am still a relative emacs noob, much of this config is derived from the setup of "Alex Payne":http://github.com/al3x and "David Nolen":http://github.com/swannodette.

h2. Notes

* I've mapped my caps lock key to function as a control key. Things are way more comfy if you make that switch.
* Emacs will pick the color theme based on time of day. Right now alternating between dark/light Solarized themes.
* scss-mode is hardcoded to compile with the @--compressed@ flag on save. To change this you'll have to alter @vendor/scss-mode@.
* Don't forget to byte compile j2-mode on your own machine @emacs --batch --eval '(byte-compile-file "~/.emacs.d/vendor/js2/js2.el")'@

h2. Why?

p. @https://jgv@github.com/jgv/my-emacs.git@ and I'm home.
